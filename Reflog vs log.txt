Git uses a system called reference log, or simply "reflog," to keep track of modifications to the branches' tips. A reference, often known as a "ref," is a pointer to a commit or branch that many Git commands accept as a parameter. git checkout, git reset, and git merge are examples of some common git commands that accept refs as parameters.

			By default, reflogs keep track of each HEAD position throughout the last 90 days. Furthermore, the reflog history is exclusive to the repository and is not accessible remotely.


Reflogs are stored in specific directories under the local repository's .git directory. These git reflog directories can be found at .git/logs/refs/heads/., .git/logs/HEAD, and also .git/logs/refs/stash if the git stash has been used on the repository.
